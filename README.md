This is a minimalist Snake game on Python called "PySnake". 
Manage your snake using arrow keys. Your goal is to collect apples on the map. 
It's also available to customize your game using "Settings" tab, where you can set the speed of snake and its color, initial size of snake and size of a space (a gap on the grid).
